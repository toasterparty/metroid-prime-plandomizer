# Trial of the Warrior

*This plando debuted on August 29th 2021 as the 5th weekly race.*

Trial of the Warrior is a beginner friendly trick level plandomizer with an intermediate+ combat expectation as inferred by the name.

In this Plando, you will be challenged to perform great feats under unexpected circumstances.

# Features
- Power Conduits can be activated with power beam
- Items are no longer confirmed to the games vanilla pick up locations.
- Note that the doors showing on the map will may not match the actual doors in game. (Vertical doors will always be vanilla colors, special doors are all "Gray")
- Gully.

# Required Techniques
- Most tricks expected are beginner tricks as per randovania database, but there are some intermediate/advanced requirements not normally considered.
- PoNR trips are required but will never result in any known soft locks 
- There is an expectation to perform a beginner level slope and standable terrain trick that does not exist in the database. This alone will be a 
  challenge for players to identify when it comes to the necessary point.
- Be prepared for a VPR... what is that you ask? Hmmm

## Not Required
- Your soul.

# Hints/Spoilers
- Familiarize yourself with the new doors available to plando as these are used to some degree. Most doors will either be blue or disabled with a 
  select few being specific. Do note that no AI related doors are in the seed.
- For further door info please check: https://github.com/toasterparty/metroid-prime-plandomizer/blob/main/doc/doors/readme.md
- Use of an auto-tracker would be advised. Why? Find out.
- Their are no intentional soft locks. Any you find are purely accidental.
- Use your save stations to your advantage. Don't want to get caught out by something unexpected!

P.s. Remember, the aim of this is to be challenging to those who perform in the weekly Prime Rando races while offering some amazing new bizarre 
situations. The aim is to have fun and get a giggle and remember, the game aint over till the credits roll!
